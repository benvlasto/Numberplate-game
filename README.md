For any 3 letters, this program finds every English word with those letters in order, but not necessarily consecutively. For instance, "AAA" could be "BANANA" or "MASCARA" or 2736 other words. On the other hand, "HZX" can only be "CHLORDIAZEPOXIDE" or its plural.

The number plate game originated as a game to play on road trips, where for some number plate you see out the window that ends with 3 letters (standard UK format) you try to find a word according to the rules above.
